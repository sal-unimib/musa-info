<h1>Outdoor Wayfinding - <em>Wiz</em>&hairsp;RD</h1>

<p>Wayfinding platforms help users navigate both indoor and outdoor environments in real-time. Many existing systems
    primarily optimize either distance or time, neglecting other important factors such as personal comfort, perception
    of safety, or emotional responses to the environment.
</p>

<p>To overcome these limitations, we designed WizRD, a new wayfinding platform that allows users to express their
    preferences and obtain routes that optimize them. This is made possible by the fact that WizRD can automatically
    acquire and integrate new data sources, also enabling the definition of customized routing algorithms that take into
    account both data sources and user preferences. In addition, to support decision-making, WizRD includes a
    visualization dashboard that facilitates users’ understanding of how different environmental factors affect the
    recommended routes. Finally, the platform supports multimodal navigation by integrating vehicle interchange stations
    called LUMIs.</p>

<p>A prototype implementation (pictured below) developed for the area around the University of Milano-Bicocca
    demonstrates the platform’s ability to handle multimodal navigation and to address the specific needs of vulnerable
    people, such as the ones with impaired mobility, women, and children.</p>

<h1>Indoor Wayfinding</h1>

<p>Additionally, we have been working on an indoor wayfinding solution for the university buildings. In this context,
    several applications have been developed by bachelor students under our supervision: an Indoor Navigation
    application, a Digital Signage system (also called "Totem", shown below), and additional tools.</p>

<div class="horizontal-screenshot">
    <img src="totem.png" alt="Totem Home" style="border-radius:8px">
</div>

<p>At its core, the Indoor Navigation App (shown below) leverages BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacons to accurately
    localize users within a building and provide real-time directions to their destinations. Complementing the app, the
    Indoor Navigation Totem is a fixed terminal that guides users through the building without requiring localization,
    ideal for shared or public areas. Once the user displays a route on the Totem, a QR code that can be used to open
    the same route on the app is provided.</p>

<div class="vertical-screenshot">
    <img src="indoor-app.png" alt="Indoor App Home" style="border-radius:8px">
</div>

<p>The application allows users to report infrastructure issues by creating reports. When enough reports are present, an
    Incident is created automatically; to allow the administrators to manage and track these reports efficiently, we
    have developed an Incident Management Dashboard and a fixed lifecycle for Incidents. When an Incident is present in
    a critical part of the infrastructure (e.g., an elevator), that node is temporarily disabled and won't be used for
    navigation.</p>

<p>Both the application and the Totem connect to an internal EasyRoom instance that provides information about the
    current lectures and exams, and can efficiently direct users to their destination. In the future, we would like to
    integrate more data sources to provide contextually-aware routes that can avoid, for instance, heavily crowded
    areas.</p>

<p>Finally, to support these navigation tools, a Preprocessing Pipeline has been developed to convert architectural
    floor plans into digital maps suitable for navigation purposes, ensuring the system can quickly adapt to different
    buildings.</p>

<p>The source code is not publicly available yet, as the project is still ongoing. If you'd like to contribute, feel
    free to reach out.</p>
